## Project Description and Background
This project explores a multi-material, print-in-place needle-nose pliers design combining a rigid structural body with a flexible TPU spring region to enable compliant motion and automatic return. Print-in-place refers to mechanisms that are fabricated in a single print with moving or functional elements already integrated, minimizing post-print assembly and reducing part count. This approach is widely used in applications such as geared hinges, chainmail-style flexible fabrics, and articulated mechanical assemblies. A common and effective material pairing for print-in-place purposes is a rigid polymer such as PLA or PETG for dimensional stability combined with TPU (~95A) for elastic deformation and durability. This combination enables both structural precision and controlled flexibility within a single printed mechanism.
