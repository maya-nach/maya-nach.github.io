## Purpose and Design Overview
Syringe pumps are used in medical and laboratory settings to deliver precise volumes of fluid at controlled flow rates. Commercial systems often cost hundreds to thousands of dollars, limiting access for smaller labs and educational environments. As an alternative, this project presents a low-cost DIY syringe pump that can be made with a combination of 3D printed and off-the-shelf parts.
### Features
* This DIY syringe pump uses a **lead-screw-driven linear actuator** to advance the syringe plunger, converting rotational motor motion into precise linear displacement.
* The pump is driven by a **stepper motor** and controlled by an **Arduino**.
* The system supports **10 and 20 mL syringes**, and allows the user to **specify flow rate and syringe diameter**.
* A **limit switch** and **enclosure** improve safety and reliability of the system.
